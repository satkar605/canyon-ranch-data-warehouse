- [x] Add PKs, FKs, NOT NULLs, CHECKs

### ðŸ”¹ Sample Data (AI-Powered)
- [x] Use GPT to generate `INSERT INTO` statements per table
- [x] Maintain referential integrity across inserts
- [x] Validate FKs using test queries (`test_queries.sql`)

### ðŸ”¹ Backup
- [x] Create `.bak` file and save to `backup/`

### ðŸ”¹ Documentation
- [x] Compile `milestone2_report.docx` with:
  - Schema

- [x] Create dimension tables:
  - [x] Dim_Date (simplified, removed IsWeekend, IsHoliday, Season)
  - [x] Dim_Customer
  - [x] Dim_Service
  - [x] Dim_ServiceType (snowflake schema)
- [x] Create fact table:
  - [x] Fact_ReservationService
- [x] Add appropriate keys and constraints

### ðŸ”¹ ETL Process
- [x] Develop SQL scripts to populate dimension tables
